Welcome to the new online, dictionary of Cornish
The dictionary is written in the Standard Written Form of Cornish and the intention is that it will be constantly updated and extended
As well as adding new terminology and extending the range of the dictionary, over time information about each word and usage will also be made available as will audio files to allow the pronunciations to be heard
About the Akademi
Akademi Kernewek is recognised by Cornwall Council as the definitive body responsible for corpus planning for the Cornish language
Akademi Kernewek is responsible for setting standards for the language, developing the dictionary, place names and carrying out research
The Akademi comprises Cornish language experts and provides advice on standards for Cornish language in the Standard Written Form (SWF)
This dictionary is in the Standard Written Form (SWF) of the Cornish Language, as agreed in 2008 and reviewed in 2014
Some results may have Middle or Late variants and these are indicated M and L respectively
You can find more information about the Akademi Kernewek and its work here
Process for agreeing new terms
Step 1 - Researching new terms
The Akademi Terminology Panel researches new terms not found in the Cornish language dictionary from a variety of sources including
Cornwall Council Translation Service
Research produced by Cornish speakers on a specific topic
Details of how the Akademi researches a new term is explained here
Step 2 - Proposing new terms
All new terms are reviewed by the Akademi Board and then added to the online Cornish language dictionary, clearly tagged as a 'proposed term' for at least one year
Comments are invited on any proposed terms
Step 3 - Approving new terms
After a new term has been listed online for at least one year, all comments will be considered by the Akademi and the proposed term reconsidered if necessary
The Terminology Panel may then recommend to the Akademi Board that the 'proposed term' become an official term for the Cornish language dictionary
'Middle' and 'Late' Cornish Forms
Today’s Cornish speakers use several different forms of the language
This applies to the spoken varieties as well as to orthographic systems
Basically, two ‘poles’ can be identified at the ends of a continuum that houses all kinds of spoken Cornish: Revived Middle Cornish (RMC) and Revived Late Cornish (RLC)
In order to make things a bit clearer to learners, two tags have been chosen to mark words that are perceived as either exclusively Revived Middle Cornish (marked “M”) or Revived Late Cornish (marked “L”)
Words that are in use across different groups of speakers with both RMC and RLC backgrounds are thought of as ‘common’ and are therefore not marked by any tag
While in theory RMC and RLC may be defined as sharply distinct varieties of Cornish, the language spoken by many today is situated somewhere in between
For example some users of Middle Cornish-based orthographies will pronounce Middle Cornish long nn in words like penn ‘head’ as dn and say pedn, which is normally considered a feature of RLC
The SWF does not have a bias towards any end of the continuum and tagging is simply meant to help people choose forms that suit their style of Cornish
All kinds of Cornish are encouraged
Tagging provides additional information and makes forms that have hitherto been used by only one group available to everybody
Pronunciation
One of the next stages of the Cornish language dictionary project is to add recordings to help learners hear how each word should be said
The aim of the Akademi is to start adding recordings in 2020
Traditional graphs
By default, this dictionary writes <k> for /k/, <hw> for /ʍ/ or /hw/, and <-i> for word-final /i/
The Standard Written Form also makes provision for the use of 'traditional graphs' such as word-final <y>, which are held to be equally correct, for personal use
If you use 'traditional graphs' when writing the SWF, please refer to the following table to help you in using the dictionary
