I will go
I would go
will you go?
I can go
I could go
the book is in my house
there is a book in my house
there is not a book in my house
where is the book?
where is the book?
is the book here?
they are in my house
the books are in my house
the book which is in my house
Is there a book in my house?
Is there not a book in my house?
I do 
I make
if the man would make it
Can you speak Cornish?
I can
Some might be prepared to say
I am loving
I am loved
shall I love?
I am going to London
you were coming home
I was born in Cornwall
I am glad to see you
I do not see the man
 I did not see the man
Did you ever see?
Do you see us?
How do you call that?
Why do you do this?
Will you go with me?
I will go to see you
I went to meet the train
we are glad to see you
there is a book to me
there is not a book to me
Is there a book to me?
There are many wives
Worse than grains 
Better left
Than taken
And there are man women
Like the bees
They will help their men
To earn the goods of the world
Children without knowledge
But if they do consider
What their play is like
And consider well
To gather their food
He was welcomed I know well.
