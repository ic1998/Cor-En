I'm sixty-five years old
I'm a poor fisherman
I learnt Cornish when I was a boy
I was at sea with my father and five more men in a fishing boat
I barely heard a single word of English in the boat for a whole week
I have never seen a Cornish book
I learnt Cornish going to sea with old men
There are no more than four or five in our village who can speak Cornish now, old people, eighty years old.
Cornish is all forgotten by young people.
